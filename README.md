# BotSpammerDiscord
An experimental Discord bot created to provoke raids within servers. This bot mentions all users on the server where it is located, aiming to stimulate activity and engagement. Use with caution and ensure compliance with Discord's guidelines and policies.

Example of use:
1. Go to the site [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create your own bot.
3. Take the token from the bot.
4. Insert the token into `config.py`
```python
TOKEN = 'youre_token_here
```
5. Add the bot to the available server.
6. Start the `python bot.py`

## ATTENTION!!! The author of this script is not responsible in case of a raid on the server. All responsibility rests with the user who uses the script for their own purposes!
